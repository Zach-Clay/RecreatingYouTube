# Recreating YouTube
Recreating YouTube for HTML/CSS practice. Only using vanilla HTML and CSS.

## What I learned
I wanted to take on this mini project in order to make sure I am comfortable with vanilla HTML and CSS. I have been relying on Bootstrap for grids and responsive designs and I wanted to be sure that I completely understand the CSS fundamentals. 
Here are some CSS techniques that I used to build the YouTube Clone:
- Nested Layout Techniques
- Display: block and inline block
- Grids
- Flexboxes
- Position (static, relative, absolute)
